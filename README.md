# dim-wish-list-splitter

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs (https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources).

Separates PvE, PvP, Controller, and MKB rolls into seperate txt files. 

If there isn't a PvE or PvP roll it is sent to the MissingTag file. All MKB files are weapons where Controller wasn't present.
