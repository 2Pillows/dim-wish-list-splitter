# dim-wish-list-splitter

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs (https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources).

Separates PvE, PvP, Controller, MKB, and their combinations into seperate files.

If no PvE or PvP tag it's added to both. If no Controller tag it's added to MKB.
